## Key Valuation Methodologies

### Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)

- Scenario-based projections
- Custom discount rate calculation
- Terminal value sensitivity analysis
- Free cash flow to firm (FCFF) and equity (FCFE) variants

### Relative Valuation
- Dynamic peer group construction
- Historical and forward-looking multiples
- Sector-specific valuation metrics
- Growth-adjusted ratios
- Regression-based valuation bands

### Sum-of-the-Parts (SOTP)
- Business unit segmentation
- Separate valuation methodology per segment
- Holding company discount assessment
- Conglomerate analysis
- Hidden asset identification

### Real Options Valuation
- Growth option modeling
- Abandonment option quantification
- Expansion flexibility valuation
- Deferral option analysis
- Monte Carlo simulation integration
